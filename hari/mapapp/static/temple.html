        The Arulmigu Subramaniya Swamy Temple is a Hindu temple, on the hill of Tiruttani, Tiruvallur district, Tamil Nadu, India,
        dedicated to Murugan. The hill has 365 steps indicating 365 days of the year. It is fifth among the six abodes of Murugan 
        (Arupadai Vidu) The other five are Palani Murugan Temple, Swamimalai Murugan Temple, Thiruchendur Murugan Temple, 
        Thiruparankundram and Pazhamudircholai Murugan Temple. Tiruttani is 87 kilometres (54 mi) from Chennai. It is the only adobe 
        located within the Greater Chennai Metropolitan Area limit. During the Sangam era, Tiruttani was known as Kundruthoradal. After
        killing the asura Tarakasura in Tiruchendur, he came here to subside his anger, so Surasamharam is not conducted here.The origins 
        of this temple, are buried in antiquity. This temple has been mentioned in the Sangam period work Tirumurugatruppadai composed by 
        Nakkeerar. It has been patronized by the Vijayanagara rulers and local chieftains and zamindars. The original animal mount of Murugan
        is believed to have been an elephant, compared to the peacock which is considered to be the most common mount. The white elephant, is
        considered a powerful, terror striking animal. The iconography is maintained only in two places, namely, this temple and Tiruttani Murugan Temple.
