                The sacred tanks of the shrines of our Lord are all known as Saravanapoikai sacred pond of the reedy marsh where Lord Karttikeya was born. The tank at Tiruttani, which (unlike in other places) is at the very foot of the hill, is particularly renowned for its sacred water (teertham) having curative effect for ailments both bodily and mental, as it is rich in minerals such as sulfur, iron, etc. A bath in this holy tank refreshes the devotee and makes him hale and healthy to propitiate our Lord with faith and devotion.
