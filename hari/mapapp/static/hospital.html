        It is the only big hospital in a small town, catering to not only to the resident people but also
        to the people from  the  surrounding villages and other nearby towns such as Tiruvallur, Arakkonam,
        Sholingur and Nagari. The townspeople know us for the quality of our services, for our sensitives,
        and for our ethical high standards.Before the hospital came up in 2017, its people had to travel to
        Chennai and other big cities for treatment. Now, however, the best of the benefits of city hospitals
        are available in the neighbourhood.It is a 100-bedded hospital on a 50,000 sq.ft campus. It has a 
        built up area of 40,000 sq.ft that houses high-end diagnostic and treatment facilities, including 
        hitech labs, MRI, CT scan and dialysis stations, CSSDs, high-tech OTs, ICUs and special labour rooms.
        The building also has an emergency hall; consulting rooms; waiting areas for patients and their caretakers;
        and patient wards, both general and private.The entire building is connected through ramps and bed lifts to
        aid fast and  smooth patient transfers. Also on the campus, there is a car park that can accommodate up to 30 cars
         and 150 two wheelers. Besides, the hospital has its own water and power management plants, fire fighting unit, and
          facelities for effluent and waste management.
